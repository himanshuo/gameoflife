Things to Display
===========
* current tasks
* a way to add more tasks - NOT the ability to add more tasks on the front page though since that is 
* questions that allow the system to determine whether you have completed recurrsing tasks or not
* Himanshu points
* Achievement points
* A way to see things in the backlog of tasks to do. Only a small portion. Perhaps just the tasks that have deadlines comming up.
* 

Thoughts
========
* title can be in 
* The reason sublime text is so awesome is partially because it is able to display lots of information at the same time.
* Another reason sublime text is awesome is the skinny font.
* I tried looking at other options for designs on sublime text, I ended up choosing this current one. Why?
* There should not be too many tasks shown in the frontpage. There is should not be too little. The goal is to show that work is being done (more tasks) but that it is not overwhelming (less tasks). ~ 5 tasks is enough to show. Consider that these tasks are NOT small tasks.
* I was thinking that a rows of tasks should appear. HOWEVER, considering that I am only showing 5 tasks, do we need rows? Perhaps summary CARDS is what I need.
* I am thinking about a very light white mellow background. The cards (which are rectangular but with VERY round edges) should NOT have a border. They just fade into the background. 
* I like the long skinny waterbottles. Why? They are sleek and sexy. Rectangles should be long and thin. How does life make sense here? Less meat. More clarity.
* Thinking about the long skinny rectanges, I don't think it will look good.
* 

Goals of Design
===========
* minimalistic - show only info that needs to be shown
* clarity - life is complex. This game makes it simple.
* should not have to give titles to things. It should be clear what things are just by looking at them
* seperation lines are BAD. We want NATAURAL organization
